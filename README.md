# Heartify: Heart Disease Prediction with Explainable AI

Heartify is an advanced heart disease prediction web application built with Flask. It integrates Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent, interpretable insights into model predictions. The application helps users understand their heart health by offering accurate predictions along with detailed explanations of the contributing factors.

## üöÄ Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Utilizes SHAP to explain model predictions.
- **Dynamic SHAP Charts**: Includes summary plots, dependence plots, bar plots, waterfall plots, and force plots.
- **Navigation for SHAP Charts**: Easy navigation between SHAP explanation charts with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Generates a comprehensive PDF report containing:
  - Prediction results  
  - SHAP charts  
  - AI explanations  
  - Heart health tips
- **Dark Theme UI**: Modern, user-friendly interface designed with Tailwind CSS.
